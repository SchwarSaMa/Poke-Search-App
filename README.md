# Poke-Search-App

## About the Project

This Pokémon Search App allows you to quickly look up detailed information about any Pokémon by entering its name or ID. The app retrieves data such as the Pokémon's image, ID, name, types, height, weight, and base stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed). Additionally, the background color of the image container dynamically adjusts based on the Pokémon's primary type.

## Features

- **Dynamic Data Display:** View detailed information including image, type icons, physical data (height & weight), and base stats.
- **Responsive Styling:** The background of the Pokémon image area adapts to the Pokémon’s primary type.
- **Error Handling:** Displays an alert ("Pokémon not found") if the searched Pokémon does not exist.

## Technologies

- **HTML5:** Provides the structure of the application.
- **CSS3:** Implements styling and layout using CSS variables for Pokémon type colors.
- **JavaScript:** Handles API requests, data processing, and dynamic rendering.
